    I am a final year student studying Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Ã‡ukurova University. During my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in various aspects of engineering, particularly in the realm of electronics.

Aside from my academic pursuits, I have also delved into the world of game development. Over the course of two years, I dedicated myself to exploring game design principles, honing my skills in programming and graphics, and understanding the intricacies of game mechanics.

Currently, I am expanding my knowledge and expertise by learning Python programming language. Python's versatility and widespread use across various domains intrigue me, and I am enthusiastic about mastering its capabilities.

Combining my engineering background with my passion for programming, I aspire to contribute to innovative projects that blend technology and creativity to make a meaningful impact on society.
